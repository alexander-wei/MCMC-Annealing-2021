Due  to  amount  of  data  we  have  chosen  re-OCRing  with  Tesseract  v.  3.04.01  as our  main  method for improving  the  quality of our collection.  In the  rest of the  paper we describe the results we have achieved so far and discuss lessons learned. In section two we describe our initial results, in section three improvements made in the re-OCR process and in section four the latest re-OCR results. Section five concludes the paper with some lessons that we have learned during the process. 2Results – Part I Our  re-OCR  process  has  been  described  thoroughly  in  [12–13].  As  its  main  parts  are unchanged,  we  describe  it  only  briefly  here.  The  re-OCRing  process  consists  of  four parts:  1)  image  preprocessing  of  page  images  using  five  different  techniques:  this yields better quality images for the OCR, 2) Tesseract OCR 3.04.01, 3) choosing of the best candidate from Tesseract’s output and old ABBYY FineReader data and 4) trans-formation of Tesseract’s output to ALTO format. We have developed a new Finnish Fraktur  model  for  Tesseract  using  an  existing  German  Fraktur  model  as  a  starting point. We have evaluated the results of the re-OCR along the development process with different  measures  using  our  ground  truth  data  of  about  500 000  words  [14].  This parallel  data  consists  of  proof  read  version  of  the  data,  current  ABBYY  FineReader OCR v.7/8, Tesseract 3.04.01 OCR and ABBYY FineReader v.11 OCR.
