% 4x4 worked for me: horizontal to vertical split
% checking for top eight to be all zero
% 5x5 works
% 6x6 as well
% 7x7 too

% might automate this in a future upload

% and now 

M = 8; N = 8;

% check the region defined by CHKR_X x CHKR_Y
CHKR_X = 1:N; CHKR_Y = 1:4;

succ = 0;

tic

% init starting grid

grid_ = ones(M, N);
grid_(1:M,CHKR_Y) = zeros(M,length(CHKR_Y));


while ~succ
    succ = horizToVertSim(grid_,CHKR_X,CHKR_Y);
    pause(.05);
    count = count+ 1;
end


disp("this took " + count + " iterations")


function V = slowcooling(I)
    V = .6 - .59 * (I ./ length(I));
end
